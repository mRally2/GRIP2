   <hr>

      <li>Some vehicles lose total control without the possibility of recovery from unexpected rear traction loss not forced by the use of the handbrake</li>
      <li>Understeer might be enhanced by the nature of how the setups are made</li>
   </ul>
   <p><br></p>
   <p><strong>DISCLAIMER</strong></p>
   <hr>
   <ul>
      <li>This mod’s still under development. Future revisions featuring new vehicles or handling fixes are planned</li>
      <li>To revert back to vanilla use Steam to verify your files. For DLC exclusive vehicles you might have to delete the folders manually</li>
      <li>The configs of some vehicles are shared therefore they get similar tunes applied. They are not missing!</li>
      <li>The custom input config is recommended for better grip feel</li>
      <li>Some vehicles still have drifting behaviour which upgrading them might solve the issue</li>
